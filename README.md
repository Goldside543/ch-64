# ch-64, AKA, CrapHash
A crappy ahh hashing function. Not really much to say about it. You probably don't want to use it for something important. I just made it on a whim, for funsies.

You might know my other project, [Goldspace](https://github.com/Goldside543/goldspace). Well, the ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) algorithm there uses a precursor to CH-64!
